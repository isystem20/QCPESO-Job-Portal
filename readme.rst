Job Portal and Content Management System with Labor Market Information System for Quezon City Public Employment Service Office (QC PESO)

The main objective in developing the system is to help job seekers be informed about the current and latest available jobs and to assist the QC PESO in their day-to-day operation. The proponents developed a website as it is a great platform to reach many applicants and it is convenient for the users to access from any location.
